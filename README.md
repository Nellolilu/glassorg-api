### 🏢 ABOUT
**Plattform & Network App**  for companies to share their approache on sustainble development and **join the movement on corporate transparency**.




I'm always courious what is happening behind the doors of companies, stores, private business people, as they have a *big impact and responsability to our social and ecological environent*. It's not only about big players as Mercedes or H&M - it's also about agencies, organizations, the hairdresser around the corner.
I personally would like to be able to choose who i bring my money to -  whether as private person or as a buisness

👉 Companies can be transparent on questions to their *ecologial, economical and social* behavior
👀 and they could and should prove it - **show the bill, show your staff, your tax report, and who you work with**
(☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞ idea to see this a change for **good competion**
